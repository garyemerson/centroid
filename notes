TODO
----
* add search icon in input bar to make more obvious that it's a search bar when unfocues and non-empty
* button to remove selected city
* search box focus shortcut (ctrl/cmd+L)
* Immediate calculation instead of having to push button
* Allow arrow keys to be used in dropdown selection
* Improve centroid caclulation. Ex of bad calculation:
    (40.7127837, -74.0059413) New York (NY), United States
    (37.566535, 126.9779692) Seoul, South Korea
    (28.7040592, 77.10249019999999) Delhi, India
    ->
    (66.35004282576419,95.42624122951958)
    lat is higher than all three lats of original points which doesn't make sense

Idea
----
1) Select 3 popular cities around the world
    * Live query from google maps api
    * Each selection add small maps preview box
2) Press "compute centroid" button
    * Pass coordinates to rust code for computation
3) Draw big centroid illustration below all preview boxes
    * Receive results from rust
